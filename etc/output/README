This directory is to store any output that should be checked into the repository.

Most of the time, when running scripts, it is not necessary to keep the output, 
so it is normal to send it to PROJECT_ROOT/etc/tmp, whence it can be deleted 
before the next iteration of the experiment is done. However, occasionally not 
only an experiment's results, but its whole output is worth keeping, so it 
can be reanalysed later.
In these cases it should go in here.
