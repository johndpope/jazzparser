This directory contains scripts relating to testing. There are two types of 
testing represented here: unit tests and script tests.

Unit tests use Python's unittest framework. They run tests on the code's 
internal API, instantiating objects, calling methods, etc.

The script tests run other scripts to check that they function correctly. 
They don't do much (if any) checking of the output, but just check that no 
errors are generated when the scripts run. The idea is to check that the 
command-line API works and that the code handles the types of input it's 
supposed to.

Running
=======
A single script can be used to run the whole suite of tests: all_tests. Call:
> ./all_tests
and check the output in tests.out.

Search the output file for lines beginning with "ERROR":
> grep ERROR tests.out
If nothing shows up, the tests all succeeded. Yay!
