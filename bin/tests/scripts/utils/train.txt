Well, she was just 17
You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another Whooh
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another Whooh
Since I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another Whooh
Since I saw her standing there 

The world is treating me bad... Misery

I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad... Misery

I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag... Misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

Send her back to me
Cos everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one, lonely one

Send her back to me
Cos everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery Oh oh oh
In misery Ooh ee ooh ooh
My misery La la la la la la

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah

Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, cos I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah

And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

In my mind there's no sorrow

There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
