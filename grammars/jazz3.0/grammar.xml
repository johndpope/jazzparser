  <!--
    This is an upper bound on the number of categories theoretically 
    possible given the formalism and this grammar's lexicon and rules. It is 
    used by the models for smoothing. If it is too low, the model will 
    not be valid, but the lower it can be set with good justification the 
    better the smoothing will be.
