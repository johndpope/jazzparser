NLTK is fully included here at the current revision from the time 
when it was introduced to the Jazz Parser. It's an open source project 
and freely available to download, so there's no problem with including
it in the codebase. It was once here as a svn external, but since 
we moved to Git it's just included here.

For more information about NLTK, including the latest version 
of the code, see:
