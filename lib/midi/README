===============

This is a midi file handling package for Python based on that written 
by Giles Hall. See http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymidi/ for details 
of the original package.
This is now developed as the open-source library Pymidi2.

No documentation was provided for the original package, but the 
interface is straightforward. I have modified the library to fix some 
bugs, restructure the code quite a bit and add more code, particularly 
to do with system exclusive (mainly tuning) events.

I have offered my modified version of the library to Giles and hope 
that it may be incorporated into the Sourceforge project. In the 
meantime, this is my own much-improved branch of the package.
