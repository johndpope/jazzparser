		Creates a tonal space path, converts it to state labels and converts 
		it back again. This should produce the original path if all goes 
		well.
		
		Note that the result of the back conversion will always have the 
		path shifted so it starts as close as possible to the origin. This is 
		correct behaviour: the state labels don't encode the enharmonic 
		block that the path starts in and it is merely by convention that we 
		assume the start point.
		
		Each path-chord sequence pair also gives the expected output, which
