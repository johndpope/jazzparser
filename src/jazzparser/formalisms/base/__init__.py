"""Common base code for all formalisms.

This provides the abstract base classes for all formalisms. It can 
never be used itself, as all the classes are merely prototypes for 
real formalisms.

This base package contains a lot of useful base classes for code that is 
either common to all formalisms, or that is frequently used across many 
formalisms.
