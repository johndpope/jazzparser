------ [DONE]

Redefine equality for LFs so that those with different times are 
considered unequal.

 - Any use of the time_assignment kwarg or any other occurrence of the term.

 - Temporal.time_assignment_as_literal_time_list() - now 
    get_literal_time_list() and does take an id arg.
  + Not used anywhere
 - Temporal.time_assignment_as_time_list() has likewise become 
    get_time_list().
  + Not used anywhere
 - Temporal.add_time_to_timed_objects() has become set_time_of_timed_objects().
