This directory contains simplified versions of the midi corpus.

The simplification has been performed using the simplify.py script in 
bin/data/midi/. It puts all events in one track, one instrument and 
removes most events that are not note-ons or note-offs.
Channel distinctions were maintained to avoid confusion with multiple 
simultaneous instances of the same note in different instruments.

Simplification was performed with the command:
for file in `ls -1 ../../../input/midi/corpus/*.mid`; do ./simplify.py -d -p -x -o -t -c --ch --mc --rno $file `dirname $file`/simple/`basename $file`; done
