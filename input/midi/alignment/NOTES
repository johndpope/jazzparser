I've not finished the alignment process yet.

In future, it will be possible to store alignment parameters along 
with a midi file and referencing a chord sequence in the database, 
so that a sequence can be immediately aligned with any midi files 
that we have for it.

In the meantime, I've been testing the alignment process by setting 
the parameters on the command line. This was the command that I used 
to align Afternoon in Paris with afternoon_in_paris-0.mid:

./midialign.py ../../input/sequences:1 ../../input/midi/afternoon_in_paris-0.mid ../../input/midi/alignment/afternoon.mid --mbpb 1 --ss 122 --repeats 0,43,2

That pulls it out of the SI file and sets the 3 parameters for 
alignment. --mbpb 1 is the default. --ss 122 starts the chord sequence 
a little after the first note in the midi file. --repeats 0,43,2 makes 
the whole chord sequence get repeated twice (3 times in total), to 
match the midi file.

The sample output is in afternoon.mid, which has markers inserted for 
the chords.
