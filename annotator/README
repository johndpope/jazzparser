## Graphical annotator tool for chord sequence data ##
######################################################

This is a web-based, database-backed annotation tool for annotating chord 
sequence data with grammatical analyses. If you just want to use the Jazz 
Parser, this won't be of interest to you. 

The tool can be run locally: 
 $ ./django-admin runserver 8080
and then accessed via a web browser at http://localhost:8080.

The analyses are stored in a database and can be output to a format acceptable 
for the Jazz Parser.

There's also a Gtk graphical tool, which is mainly for associating MIDI 
data with the sequences in the database. I never finished writing this, 
so there are bits missing, but they're all provided by the web-based tool.
