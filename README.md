The Jazz Parser
===============

This codebase contains a parser for discovering harmonic structure in 
chord sequences and (in a limited fashion) MIDI files. The software is 
written in Python and can be run on Linux, Mac or Windows (though it's 
largely been tested on Linux).

Please see LICENSE for information about the license covering the code.
It is open source and distributed under the GPL.

I developed this codebase during my PhD project. For more details see 
[the Jazz Parser website](http://jazzparser.granroth-wilding.co.uk/ "Jazz Parser").
User-level documentation is currently fairly limited, but what there is 
can be found there.

API documentation for developers using the code can be found 
[here](http://jazzparser.granroth-wilding.co.uk/api/ "API docs")

This repository allows you to get hold of the latest version of the code. 
This may not be in a stable state. If you're looking for slightly more stable 
code, get the 
[latest release from the website](http://jazzparser.granroth-wilding.co.uk/Parser "Jazz Parser release"). 
Either way, bear in mind that this is a research project, so take the 
term "stable" with a pinch of salt.
