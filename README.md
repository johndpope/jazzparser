The Jazz Parser
===============

A parser for jazz chord sequences to infer harmonic structure, written in 
Python.

I developed this codebase during my PhD project. For more details see 
[the Jazz Parser website](http://jazzparser.granroth-wilding.co.uk/ "Jazz Parser").

This repository does not yet contain the Jazz Parser's code. I will be moving 
it here soon. In the meantime, you can get hold of the latest release 
from the [website](http://jazzparser.granroth-wilding.co.uk/Parser "Jazz Parser release").
